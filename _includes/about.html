                      <p class="text-muted"> I am Sanju Gharti Chhetri, a PhD candidate in Instructional Design and Development at the University of South Alabama, where I specialize in developing innovative, learner-centered programs grounded in strong design and learning principles. My academic journey began in Nepal with degrees in Social Work followed by a Master's in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies from Oregon State University. My professional path reflects a commitment to empowering communities and advancing educational equity across diverse contexts. Currently, as a Graduate Research Assistant on the NSF-funded PEPTICC project, I conduct design-based research to develop computational thinking curricula for K-6 pre-service teachers. My work involves applying instructional design frameworks like micro-learning, embodied design, and collaborative learning to help educators effectively integrate educational robotics into their teaching. I am passionate about translating research insights into actionable design solutions that create meaningful learning experiences for diverse populations. Beyond academia, I have represented Nepal as a youth delegate at the 69th United Nations General Assembly, advocating for youth-led accountability in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. My published work explores themes ranging from gender and inclusive governance to educational technology, reflecting my interdisciplinary approach to addressing complex social and educational challenges. As I approach the completion of my doctoral studies, I am eager to apply my collaborative leadership style, research expertise in emerging educational technologies, and commitment to inclusive design to advance effective learning experiences and user-centered educational solutions. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and practical application, particularly in the rapidly evolving areas of AI integration and technology-enhanced learning. My goal is to create meaningful, evidence-based learning experiences that empower diverse learners and foster positive educational change.  </p>

My dissertation, Exploring University Educators’ Competence, Acceptance, and Use of Generative AI in Education explores  how higher education faculty perceive, adopt, and integrate Generative AI tools in their teaching. By combining validated survey instruments with open-ended inquiries, my research offers empirical insights into educators’ technological and pedagogical readiness, the factors influencing GenAI adoption, and evidence-based recommendations for policy, professional development, and teaching. I also have experience working on instructional design projects that involve course redesign, needs assessment, and program evaluation to improve student learning and engagement. </p>
