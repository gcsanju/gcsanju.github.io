                      <p class="text-muted"> I am a PhD Candidate in Instructional Design and Development at the University of South Alabama. My work focuses on integrating technology, pedagogy, and user experience to improve teaching and learning outcomes. Currently, my research focuses on exploring the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in education, with a focus on university faculty’s use of GenAI for teaching, instruction, and learning purposes. My dissertation explores how higher education faculty perceive, adopt, and integrate Generative AI tools in their teaching. By combining validated survey instruments with open-ended inquiries, my research offers empirical insights into educators’ technological and pedagogical readiness, the factors influencing GenAI adoption, and evidence-based recommendations for policy, professional development, and teaching. I also have experience working on instructional design projects that involve course redesign, needs assessment, and program evaluation to improve student learning and engagement. </p>
